# Chainer implementation of Attention-based SEQ2SEQ model

Chainer-based implementation of Attention-based seq2seq model.

See "[Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473)", Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, Yoshua Bengio, arxiv 2014.

This repository is partly derived from [this repository](https://github.com/nakario/segnmt) and Chainer's official [seq2seq example](https://github.com/chainer/chainer/tree/master/examples/seq2seq).
